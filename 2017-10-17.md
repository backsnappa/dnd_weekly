- Long rest uneventful save for scratching at the doors during second watch
- Party decides to investigate 1st door (left) corridor. Twelve barrels of what smells like ale and sacks of grain
- Room across the hall has a stairwell that leads down to another door
- Second room on left: rustling noises heard
- Third door on left -> dining room. Table is surrounded with stone statues in various states of feasting
- Return to Second room on left. Five small humaniods ransacking the room. Party vanquishes the goblins. No treasure. Leroy - close to death, takes a potion and is returned to full health.
- Adventurers travel into beginning of cavernous hallways one story below main floor. Encounter chained white ape (freed) which subsequently attacks those not wearing Haven armor (Grim, Leroy, Hugh). Egbert calms the ape and continues to explore with Tugg and ape.
- Tugg is attacked by a snake in the ornate room cabinet but lives. Party takes a long rest. Hugh does some morning drinking but returns safely. Party finds a bathroom with several flying creatures. Hugh recklessly rushes into the room and is subsequently attacked. He retreats to the cabinet room and the creature is dispatched.
- The party engages the remaining striges. Grim is felled. Egbert is felled. The stirges are finally dispatched and mushrooms are roasted to stabilize Grim and Egbert. The party rests and recovers to full health.
- The center room awaits. Leroy grabs an emerald green pendant and begins to laugh hysterically.
- The party uses a key discovered in the previous room to open two keyholes, causing the mosaic in the Mosaic Room to disappear and a blue-white glowing longsword to appear floating in the center of the room. Egbert goes to take the sword causing a black knight to materialize and attack.
- Physical attacks are ineffective but a Sacred Flame attack causes the knight to vanish. Egbert takes the sword which emits a blue light in a 30-foot radius. Attempts to cure Leroy of his insanity fails and the party trudges onward. At the end of a downward staircase an underground courtyard is discovered with smashed statues which have been replaced with a crude tentacled eye statue. The statue resembles the tattoos found on the assasins of Tugg's mom - Tugg asked for the statue to be decimated.
- Party continued exploring, discoverting a room of arguing hobgoblins. The hobgoblins are easily dispatched. During this time, Leroy manages to douse himself with Acid Splash and renders himself unconcious.
